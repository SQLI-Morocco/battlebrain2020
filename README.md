## Topic

### Context

Hi, I’m Younes, I was happy to hear we are returning to work at SQLI offices! With the new health security policy, now the seats are no longer nominative, humm that’s an issue what if I come up late and find the sweet spot next to the window already taken?! If only there was some way simple and intuitive to choose my place...

Oh wait! We do have skilled peoples at SQLI and I believe they can help provide a solution for me to book my seat in advance!

Hey, another problem comes to my mind, how can I make sure to comply to social distancing rules while choosing my seat? Can this solution system recommend me a place appropriate based on some pre-defined rules?

Also, why not the solution even suggest seats next to my team members?

### Challenge To Solve!

Hello SQLI Talents! Can you help Younes solve his problem?

Intermediate Uses Cases:

- Younes has the possibility to book a secure seat for one or more time ranges based on pre-defined health security policy constraints.
- Younes can see how many seats are available and their location/position.
- The provided seats for Younes should comply to occupency rules: 
   1. 50% of all seats in one area are occupied at most.
   2. No two seats are directly located next or in front of each other.
   3. Seats are not named (no one owns the seat).
   4. Admin can override seat availability.

Advanced Uses Cases, the solution should be able to:

- Younes can see existing seats reservation with the names and teams.
- Younes can select the team he's working with and the solution proposes to him specific seats.
- Younes must select all the days per week that his team requires him to be on site.

Champions Uses Cases:

- Maybe you thought of a specific use case that can help Younes? Show us your skills!
